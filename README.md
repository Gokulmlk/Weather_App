# Weatherly — Modern Weather App (Project)

This is a modern, animated weather forecast UI built with Tailwind CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
It uses OpenWeatherMap's 5-day forecast API.

## Setup
1. Unzip the project.
2. Replace the API key in `app.js`:

   ```
   with your OpenWeatherMap API key (keep the quotes).
